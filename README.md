Description

An Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a critical component in digital circuits responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations. It serves as the core computational unit in processors and other digital systems.

Key Operations of the ALU:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

Design Overview

The ALU takes the following inputs:

Operands: Data values on which operations are performed.

Control Signals: Determine which operation the ALU should execute.

Flags: Indicate conditions such as carry, overflow, zero, or negative results.

The ALU outputs the computed result along with relevant status flags.

Key Features

Efficiently designed to handle multiple operations.

Modular structure for scalability and ease of enhancement.

Suitable for integration into larger digital systems like CPUs or custom logic designs.
