An Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a critical component in digital circuits responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations, serving as the core computational unit in processors and other digital systems. The ALU performs four primary operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. It takes several inputs such as operands, which are data values on which operations are performed, control signals that determine the specific operation to execute, and flags that indicate conditions like carry, overflow, zero, or negative results. The ALU outputs the computed result along with relevant status flags. Efficiently designed to handle multiple operations, the ALU features a modular structure that enhances scalability and simplifies enhancement, making it suitable for integration into larger digital systems like CPUs or custom logic designs.
